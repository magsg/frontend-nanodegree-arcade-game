### What is Frogger Game?

Frogger game aims at testing player's dexterity and focus. The goal is to help the character reach the river without colliding into any of the enemies.

### How to play

* open `index.html` in your chosen browser
* use arrow keys to move the character up, down, left and right
* beware of the bugs! Colliding into any of them will take you back to the starting point

### How the game was built

The game utilises Object-Oriented JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas, I also added CSS styles to HTML elements.
* I implemented Player and Enemy classes
* I added properties setting eg. speed and initial location
* I added methods to update objects' locations and handle collisions
* I added congratulations modal to mark the end of the game
